When developing a product, service or customer experience we usually start with building
the MVP(MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT)

MVP is not an end product but a baseline that reflects the core functionality enabling
us to leanr from user feedback.

With agile we can develop a new product in both an ITERATIVE and INCREMENTAL process.

AGILE DEVELOPMENT METHODS

1. ITERATIVE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT - 

Start with a draft . Increase details as we go along. 

We do not have to finish the product in mind as we can change it as we develop.

At every stage a client will receive something usable even if it does not match their needs

In short we can deliver apps using MVP CONCEPT to showcase at different stages to user.

STEPS:
A- Start with draft
B- Create a prototype on paper
C- Have something functional
D- As time goes by add more features.

2. INCREMENTAL PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

This creating one piece at a time. eg interface, buttons, etc

We usually have the full idea formulated before development.

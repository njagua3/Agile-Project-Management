/* AGILE PROJECT MANAGEMENT

Agile Methodologies

In the past project management relied on the waterfall method.

This method is based on detailed upfront planning$ phase execution.
It worked well projects that had fixed goals $ clear requirements.

1980's Agile Methodologies were developed by Hirotaka Takeuchi $ Nonaka.

It focused on delivery increment $ ability  to adapt quickly tochanging requirements.

Agile encourages innovation & improves collaboration among team members. 

It aslo allows plan modification . This helps to overcome unexpected challenges and take
advantage of opportunities as they come.

The transition to agile is about embracing change and ensuring we can easily adjust
to new demands.

Being open to change is a strength and not a problem.

Agile prioritizes delivering tangible value and continous improvement.
It is built on collaboration, trust, & respect for those who do the work.

Benefits of Agile Methodologies;
-Collaboration
-Trust & respect
-Flexibility
-Deliver continous value
-Nurture improvement & growth.


When developing a product, service or customer experience we usually start with building
the MVP(MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT)

MVP is not an end product but a baseline that reflects the core functionality enabling
us to leanr from user feedback.

With agile we can develop a new product in both an ITERATIVE and INCREMENTAL process.

AGILE DEVELOPMENT METHODS

1. ITERATIVE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT - 

Start with a draft . Increase details as we go along. 

We do not have to finish the product in mind as we can change it as we develop.

At every stage a client will receive something usable even if it does not match their needs

In short we can deliver apps using MVP CONCEPT to showcase at different stages to user.

STEPS:
A- Start with draft
B- Create a prototype on paper
C- Have something functional
D- As time goes by add more features.

2. INCREMENTAL PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

This creating one piece at a time. eg interface, buttons, etc

We usually have the full idea formulated before development.

AGILE VALUES AND PRINCIPLES

 - Individuals & interactions over process and tools.

 Having a good face to face  chat should accomplish more than impersonal forms of communication

 - Working software over documentation.

 Allowing a client to experiment with a version of a working product and provide feedback
 to improve is better than docs.

 - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.

 Collaborate with clients throughout the project with the intention of finding a solution together

 - Responding to change over following a plan.
  Murphy's Law - Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.

  If something does not work it is more effective to respond to change and adjust
  the project inline with any change to the situation.


12 PRINCIPLES OF AGILE 
For a project success and customer satisfaction

- Early and continous delivery of value
  highest value is delivery of product early for the sake of client satisfaction.

- Welcome changing development even late in development.

- Deliver working components frequently. Shorter timescale preferred.

- Work with client daily

- Trust and motivate the working team

-Face 2 face conversation are effective for conveying information. Zoom meetings or in person.

-Measure Success in terms of working components. 

- Promote sustainable development. You need a constant pace for all team members

- Good design and technical excellence. 

- Maximize simplicity

- Set the team to be self organizing. - This is how best solutions emerge. 

- Make regular adjustments to the working process. - Reflect on how to be more efficient.



                     SCRUM 
 An Agile Methodology.
 
 Inspired by rugby games.

 It uses a sprint based approach to PM where teams work in defined cycles to deliver increment of product

 This promotes adaptability & swift response to changes.

 Scrum was initially developed for software development. 


      SCRUM BUILDING BLOCKS
A - ROLES
     These are people who are essential to a team for a speedy delivery and technical profociency.
     
B - Ceremonies
     These are the meetings where team members discuss, plan, and deliver.

C - Artifacts
     These are measurable documents that provide both strategic and technical direction of team

Scrum master - Ensures the team has the support they need. He/she is responsible for team's health
              - Figures out how much work a team can handle.
              - ensures team members contribute to all important scrum meetings
              - Helps the team to deliver work on time and within budget.
              - Ensures that the team's needs are being met.
               - Makes sure team is focused
               - Organizes and leads the team to plan the work sprint

Product backlog - List of all features and stories that need to be developed.
                 - It is a shared source of truth.

Sprint backlog - List of all features and stories that will be developed in a sprint.

Product owner - Defines the product and the vision of the project.

Development team - The team of developers with various skills.
                  - They work on sprint backlog.
                  - They are responsible for delivering increment of product.

Scrum board - A visual representation of the sprint process.



                  SCRUM PRACTICE
1: Role assignment based on skills and project involvement. 
2: Ceremonies - Meetings that help to align goals and share progress with team. 


                   TYPES OF CEREMONIES
1: Sprint Planning - 1st meeting on the scrum framework.
                    - scrum team sizes the work to be done.
                    - Discussion of initial planning.

2: Daily Scrum - What did I complete yesterday
               - What am I going to do today
               - What blockers are there?

3: Sprint Review - 
               - Discussion of completed work and what needs to be done next.
                - Team reflects on what has been done and what needs to be done.

4: Sprint Retrospective - 
                      - Discussion of what went well and what needs to be improved.
                       - Team reflects on how to improve and adapt to the changes.

ARTIFACTS

Agile is based on the principle of customer value prioritization.

Main concepts:
  
Product backlog - List of all features and stories that need to be developed to meet client needs.
                 Prioritized by product owner.
                 - Highest value items are pushed to the top of the list.

We prioritize values using the backlog hierarchy

       - EPICS - Large body of work
       - Features - Epics broken down.
       - User Stories - Within features we find stories that are a description of client needs
       - Tasks - User stories broken down into smaller tasks.

EPICS & FEATURES are simply a way of grouping user stories.

Prioritize using stories.

Focus on the most crucial project Tasks

WE CAN USE TOOLS LIKE THE HAVE METHOD. 

       - Must have - Non negotiable Features. If not available project fails
       - Should have - Important & significant features
       - Could have - Desirable features. Not crucial and could be added later.
       - Won't have - Features that are not important.





                             KANBAN AGILE METHODOLOGY
Kanban means visual cards and originates from Japan

To use kanban you need to follow a structured process that begins with
showing your work process visually and breaking down work into smaller tasks.

Steps:
A - Visualize the entire work flow

   Create a kanban board.
   The board shows aviasual display of the projects whole process from start to end.

   You can choose between a physical board with sticky notes or an online tool
   eg JIRA based on what the team likes and what the project requires. 

   The board should have columns for;
      - To Do
      - In Progress
      - Done
   
      This helps to view all tasks at any time for all team members.

B - Break down the work flow into smaller tasks

   Identify tasks that can be completed in one day.
   These tasks should be small and simple.
   Label the tasks with an Effort Estimate (EE) - how long it will take to complete the task.
   The Effort Estimate is in hours.
   Make sure to create a task for every user story.
   Tasks should be broken down into smaller tasks.
  
   
   TIP: Begin by listing all the tasks required to complete the project.

   Next break down large tasks into smaller tasks that are manageable and can be completed within
   a reasonable amount of time.

   This helps to smoothen the flow of work through the Kanban system. 




                       SWIM LANES

 These are horizontal lines on your kanban board that help categorize into different 
 priorities such as urgent, specific features or work for certain departments.
 
 SWIM LANES:
 - To Do
-Doing
- Done

Each lane represents a priority level.

The To Do lane is where you add tasks.

The Doing lane is where tasks are actively worked on.

The Done lane is where tasks are completed.

When a task is moved from one lane to another, it moves through the Kanban process.

You can move tasks from the To Do lane to the Doing lane and then to the Done lane.

When a task is moved from the Doing lane to the Done lane, it is considered completed.

This helps to ensure that tasks are completed in the correct order and that they are not overlooked.

The Kanban process is continuously improving.

It helps to maintain a healthy flow of work and reduces the risk of project delays.

It also helps to maintain a high level of quality and efficiency.

Remember to prioritize tasks and ensure that tasks are completed in the correct order.

Remember that Kanban is a tool, not a method.

Remember to use the Kanban process to improve your team's productivity and efficiency.


Remember to prioritize tasks and ensure that tasks are completed in the correct order.



                KANBAN PRINCIPLES

A - LIMIT WORK IN PROGRESS

Crucial for Kanban to work. 

It is vital to establish a limit on the number of tasks permitted in each column to avoid delays
blockages, and obstacles.

B - TEAM POLICIES

The team should agree on how work is organized

Ensure that the team agrees on how tasks are moved from one column to another.

C - SMART GOALS - Measure time spent to complete a full cycle.

This helps to look for ways to shorten time spent and also helps with consistency.


Kanban gives:
- Access to project data & updates which promote openness & builds stronger commitment among
the team.
- A clear understanding of the project's progress.
- Improved communication and collaboration among the team.
- A better understanding of the project's requirements and the scope.
- A visual representation of the work flow. This makes it easy to spot problems, optimize a solution
and eliminate barriers.

The result is;

- A high level of quality and efficiency.
- cost reduction
- improved customer satisfaction.
- reduced risk of project delays.


Incorporate Agile in daily routines

Start small

Embrace MVP (minimum viable product) - This means that every release doesnt need to be
perfect just good enough to invite feedback. 

Create a backlog - List goals from short term to long term or high priority to low priority

Create iterations - Prioritize list of goals/tasks.

# Agile Project Management

## Agile Methodologies

### Historical Context
In the past, project management primarily relied on the waterfall method, which was based on detailed upfront planning and phased execution. This method worked well for projects with fixed goals and clear requirements.

Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka developed Agile methodologies in the 1980s. Agile focuses on delivering increments and adapting quickly to changing requirements. It encourages innovation, improves collaboration among team members, and allows for plan modification to overcome unexpected challenges and seize opportunities as they arise.

### Core Principles
The transition to Agile involves embracing change and ensuring the ability to adjust to new demands. Being open to change is considered a strength, not a problem. Agile prioritizes delivering tangible value and continuous improvement and is built on collaboration, trust, and respect for those doing the work.

### Benefits of Agile Methodologies
- Enhanced collaboration
- Trust and respect
- Flexibility
- Continuous value delivery
- Fostering improvement and growth

## Developing with Agile

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
When developing a product, service, or customer experience, the process usually starts with an MVP (Minimum Viable Product). An MVP is not the end product but a baseline that reflects core functionality, enabling learning from user feedback.

### Agile Development Methods
1. **Iterative Product Development**
   - Start with a draft and increase details incrementally.
   - Deliver something usable at every stage, even if it does not fully meet the client’s needs.
   - Steps:
     A. Start with a draft
     B. Create a paper prototype
     C. Develop something functional
     D. Gradually add more features

2. **Incremental Product Development**
   - Develop one piece at a time (e.g., interface, buttons).
   - The full concept is typically formulated before development begins.

## Agile Values and Principles
1. **Values**:
   - **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
   - **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
   - **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
   - **Responding to change** over following a plan

2. **12 Principles**:
   - Early and continuous delivery of value
   - Welcome changing requirements, even late in development
   - Deliver working components frequently
   - Collaborate with clients daily
   - Trust and motivate the team
   - Use face-to-face communication
   - Measure success by working components
   - Promote sustainable development
   - Strive for good design and technical excellence
   - Maximize simplicity
   - Empower self-organizing teams
   - Reflect and adjust regularly

## Scrum

### Overview
Scrum is an Agile methodology inspired by rugby games. It employs a sprint-based approach to project management where teams work in defined cycles to deliver product increments. Initially developed for software development, Scrum promotes adaptability and swift responses to changes.

### Key Components
1. **Roles**:
   - **Scrum Master**: Supports the team, ensures on-time delivery, organizes and leads sprint planning, and maintains team focus.
   - **Product Owner**: Defines the product and its vision, prioritizes the product backlog.
   - **Development Team**: Delivers the sprint backlog, working collaboratively to achieve increments.

2. **Ceremonies**:
   - **Sprint Planning**: Establish goals and plan work for the sprint.
   - **Daily Scrum**: Share progress, blockers, and upcoming tasks.
   - **Sprint Review**: Reflect on completed work and discuss next steps.
   - **Sprint Retrospective**: Evaluate what went well and identify areas for improvement.

3. **Artifacts**:
   - **Product Backlog**: A prioritized list of features and stories.
   - **Sprint Backlog**: A list of features and stories for the sprint.
   - **Scrum Board**: A visual representation of the sprint process.

### Artifact Hierarchy
- **Epics**: Large bodies of work
- **Features**: Subdivisions of epics
- **User Stories**: Client needs described within features
- **Tasks**: Smaller components of user stories

### Prioritization with the HAVE Method
- **Must have**: Non-negotiable features
- **Should have**: Important and significant features
- **Could have**: Desirable but non-essential features
- **Won’t have**: Features deemed unnecessary

## Kanban Methodology
Kanban complements Agile by focusing on visualizing workflows, limiting work-in-progress, and improving process efficiency.

# AGILE PROJECT MANAGEMENT

### Agile Methodologies

In the past, project management was like the "Waterfall" method—plenty of upfront planning, slow and steady, and everything had to fall into place perfectly, like a David Fincher film. But it worked... for a while. 🧠

Enter Agile—an evolution of software development that's here to shake things up. Think of it like the Kendrick Lamar of methodologies—innovative, flexible, and here to challenge the status quo. In the 1980s, Hirotaka Takeuchi and Nonaka were like the Avengers of Agile, crafting a methodology that embraces change, adapts on the fly, and doesn't hesitate to drop bars (or features).

Just like J. Cole, Agile’s all about growth and progression. Forget rigid plans; we innovate, collaborate, and keep things moving forward. 🎤

The transition to Agile is about embracing change like Nas did when he dropped "Illmatic"—fresh, unpredictable, and full of street smarts. Being open to change is strength, not a setback. 💪

#### The Agile Advantages:
- **Collaboration**—Like the dream team of the rap world, everyone has a role, and they play it well.
- **Trust & Respect**—It's like when Nas and J. Cole collab, bringing their A-game.
- **Flexibility**—The Agile way is more flexible than Kendrick's flow.
- **Continuous Value**—Always pushing for more, just like your favorite rapper dropping back-to-back hits.
- **Improvement & Growth**—Just like Nas’s evolution from Illmatic to King's Disease.

### Developing a Product the Agile Way

We start with the **MVP**—the **Minimum Viable Product**. This isn’t the final version, but it’s our base, our "first draft," like when Kendrick first dropped "Good Kid, M.A.A.D City"—raw, but with mad potential. The MVP is just the beginning, and it lets us learn from user feedback.

With Agile, it’s all about creating iteratively and incrementally. Think of it like J. Cole’s "The Off-Season"—each track builds on the last, evolving as the album progresses.

### AGILE DEVELOPMENT METHODS

1. **Iterative Product Development**
   - Start with a draft, keep improving. 
   - The MVP is like that first mixtape you made in high school—rough but real.
   - Just like J. Cole in his "Middle Child" era, we don't have to finish the product in one go. We adapt as we go.

   **Steps:**
   - Start with a draft.
   - Create a prototype on paper (don't let the paper get too “scrappy”).
   - Deliver something functional.
   - Keep adding features, like a Nas album dropping new verses as you go.

2. **Incremental Product Development**
   - Piece by piece, like Nas layering his storytelling with every track.
   - We formulate the full idea before development—no "waiting for the beat to drop."

### Agile Values and Principles

- **Individuals & Interactions over Process and Tools**—Good face-to-face chat beats the buzzwords, like Kendrick’s storytelling over flashy visuals.
- **Working Software over Documentation**—Nothing beats trying out a working product, like hearing J. Cole’s new track before the official release.
- **Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation**—Let’s build together, like when Nas and J. Cole team up to create that one banger. 
- **Responding to Change over Following a Plan**—Because, honestly, who doesn’t love a plot twist like in every Kendrick video?

### The 12 Principles of Agile: For the Success and Satisfaction of All

1. **Early and Continuous Delivery of Value**—It's like when Kendrick drops albums with impact every time, no waiting around.
2. **Welcome Changing Requirements**—Even if the project takes a different turn, we’re flexible, like Nas going from "NY State of Mind" to "The Lost Tapes."
3. **Frequent Deliveries**—Think of it like dropping verses regularly—staying relevant, staying on point.
4. **Customer Collaboration**—Like getting feedback on the "Illmatic" tracklist, we listen and adjust.
5. **Trust & Motivation**—The team’s as tight as Kendrick and his producers—trust the process.
6. **Face-to-Face Conversations**—No “texting” in Agile. Get in the room, get real like Nas spitting bars in Queens.
7. **Measure Success by Working Components**—We want the product to "work," not just look good on paper.
8. **Sustainable Development**—Pace yourself—like J. Cole taking his time to craft timeless classics.
9. **Good Design & Technical Excellence**—Each feature should be as polished as a Nas rhyme.
10. **Maximize Simplicity**—We keep it clean, like Kendrick’s "Humble."
11. **Self-Organizing Teams**—Just like how Nas built his own lane in the rap game, teams that figure it out on their own come up big.
12. **Reflect & Adjust**—Like Cole reflecting on his journey, we constantly adapt and improve.

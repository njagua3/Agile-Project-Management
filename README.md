# Agile Project Management

## Agile Methodologies

### Historical Context
In the past, project management primarily relied on the waterfall method, which was based on detailed upfront planning and phased execution. This method worked well for projects with fixed goals and clear requirements.

Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka developed Agile methodologies in the 1980s. Agile focuses on delivering increments and adapting quickly to changing requirements. It encourages innovation, improves collaboration among team members, and allows for plan modification to overcome unexpected challenges and seize opportunities as they arise.

### Core Principles
The transition to Agile involves embracing change and ensuring the ability to adjust to new demands. Being open to change is considered a strength, not a problem. Agile prioritizes delivering tangible value and continuous improvement and is built on collaboration, trust, and respect for those doing the work.

### Benefits of Agile Methodologies
- Enhanced collaboration
- Trust and respect
- Flexibility
- Continuous value delivery
- Fostering improvement and growth

## Developing with Agile

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
When developing a product, service, or customer experience, the process usually starts with an MVP (Minimum Viable Product). An MVP is not the end product but a baseline that reflects core functionality, enabling learning from user feedback.

### Agile Development Methods
1. **Iterative Product Development**
   - Start with a draft and increase details incrementally.
   - Deliver something usable at every stage, even if it does not fully meet the client’s needs.
   - Steps:
     A. Start with a draft
     B. Create a paper prototype
     C. Develop something functional
     D. Gradually add more features

2. **Incremental Product Development**
   - Develop one piece at a time (e.g., interface, buttons).
   - The full concept is typically formulated before development begins.

## Agile Values and Principles
1. **Values**:
   - **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
   - **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
   - **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
   - **Responding to change** over following a plan

2. **12 Principles**:
   - Early and continuous delivery of value
   - Welcome changing requirements, even late in development
   - Deliver working components frequently
   - Collaborate with clients daily
   - Trust and motivate the team
   - Use face-to-face communication
   - Measure success by working components
   - Promote sustainable development
   - Strive for good design and technical excellence
   - Maximize simplicity
   - Empower self-organizing teams
   - Reflect and adjust regularly

## Scrum

### Overview
Scrum is an Agile methodology inspired by rugby games. It employs a sprint-based approach to project management where teams work in defined cycles to deliver product increments. Initially developed for software development, Scrum promotes adaptability and swift responses to changes.

### Key Components
1. **Roles**:
   - **Scrum Master**: Supports the team, ensures on-time delivery, organizes and leads sprint planning, and maintains team focus.
   - **Product Owner**: Defines the product and its vision, prioritizes the product backlog.
   - **Development Team**: Delivers the sprint backlog, working collaboratively to achieve increments.

2. **Ceremonies**:
   - **Sprint Planning**: Establish goals and plan work for the sprint.
   - **Daily Scrum**: Share progress, blockers, and upcoming tasks.
   - **Sprint Review**: Reflect on completed work and discuss next steps.
   - **Sprint Retrospective**: Evaluate what went well and identify areas for improvement.

3. **Artifacts**:
   - **Product Backlog**: A prioritized list of features and stories.
   - **Sprint Backlog**: A list of features and stories for the sprint.
   - **Scrum Board**: A visual representation of the sprint process.

### Artifact Hierarchy
- **Epics**: Large bodies of work
- **Features**: Subdivisions of epics
- **User Stories**: Client needs described within features
- **Tasks**: Smaller components of user stories

### Prioritization with the HAVE Method
- **Must have**: Non-negotiable features
- **Should have**: Important and significant features
- **Could have**: Desirable but non-essential features
- **Won’t have**: Features deemed unnecessary

## Kanban Methodology
Kanban complements Agile by focusing on visualizing workflows, limiting work-in-progress, and improving process efficiency.
